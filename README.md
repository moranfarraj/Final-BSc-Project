## Project Summary

### 1. Background and Context:
Gaming is more than just an activity; it's a form of social interaction. Traditional multiplayer gaming relies on automated matchmaking systems that often pair players with incompatible gaming styles, creating a less-than-ideal experience. 

### 2. Identified Problem:
The inherent randomness of conventional matchmaking algorithms can often result in poor team dynamics. Even within rank-based systems, the lack of nuanced filters like gaming attitude and communication style can lead to mismatched teams.

### 3. Proposed Solution:
We tackle this issue head-on with Gathering of Gamers, a groundbreaking app that aims to redefine how gamers connect. By considering multiple parameters like communication, competitiveness, and skill level, our app provides a curated matchmaking experience that brings like-minded gamers together.

### 4. Application Overview:
The app interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use, prioritizing user experience. It allows gamers to profile themselves based on three critical aspects—communication, competitiveness, and skill level—across multiple games. The interface is available in English, making it globally accessible.

### 5. Application Features and Development:
- **Real-time Chat:** Enables dynamic communication between players.
- **AI Recommendation System:** Uses advanced algorithms to find the best match based on multiple attributes.
- **Custom Search Filters:** From location to gender to game type, customize your search to find the perfect teammate.
- **Profile Customization:** Integrated with the user's phone, the app allows users to update their profile pictures directly from their Google accounts or by capturing new photos.

The backend is robustly built with Java, ensuring high performance and reliability. For frontend, we used Android-specific development tools for a seamless user experience. Firebase handles all data-related functionalities, offering enhanced security and control.

## Conclusion
Gathering of Gamers is not just another gaming app; it's a comprehensive solution aiming to revolutionize the gaming world. By taking into consideration diverse gaming styles and individual preferences, we offer a personalized gaming experience. From the tech stack to the user interface, every aspect is designed with the user in mind.

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project came from our own experiences and frustrations with existing matchmaking systems. We believe that gaming should be enjoyable, social, and inclusive, and that's what Gathering of Gamers aims to achieve.
